          Finding properties to rent or lease has been an energy draining task
          for those involved for too long. As a home seeker, you have to know
          someone who knows someone who knows a good house that's up for rent,
          or depend on agents with their hefty fees and endless tours.
          <br />
          <br />
          Landlords and property owners looking to rent and lease their
          properties and also manage their tenants have also struggled with
          irregular rent payments from existing tenants, and over-reliance on
          agents and word-of-mouth to find suitable tenants for their
          properties.
          <br />
          <br />
          For those looking for a new home and those who want to rent their
          properties, these struggles have led to a loss of huge amounts of
          money as well as unnecessary stress.
          <br />
          <br />
          That is where Xamp comes in.
